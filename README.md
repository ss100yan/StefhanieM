# 111119JWA

Below you'll find a list of required technologies and useful resources. Please note that you are welcome to use different technologies if you are more comfortable with those, but you MUST know how to use them on your own.

Software Development Kit and Runtime Environments
=================================================

Java SE Development Kit 8: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will be using Java 8 for the duration of your training. If you choose to use a more recent version of Java, understand that you are responsible for resolving compatibility issues on your own.

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
----------------------------------------
Node provides a runtime environment for JavaScript, allowing developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser.

Version Control Tools
=====================

Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
----------------------------------
We'll be using Git as our version tool. Our Git-repository manager is GitLab.

IDE
===

Spring Tool Suite 3: https://spring.io/tools3/sts/all
-----------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Do NOT download Spring Tool Suite 4. Though this version is the most current, it is not stable at the moment. If you choose to download STS 4, you are responsible for debugging any problems the IDE might cause.

DBeaver: https://dbeaver.io/download/
-------------------------------------
DBeaver is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data sources.

Text Editors
============

Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
----------------------------------------------------------
Having a text editor installed will come in handy. My text editor of choice is Visual Studio Code, but feel free to use the text editor that you're most comfortable with.

Servers
=======

Apache Tomcat: http://tomcat.apache.org/
----------------------------------------
We'll be using Tomcat servers to host our web applications. I'll be using version 8.5 of Apache Tomcat. If you choose to download another version, you should understand how to use it on your own.

Build Automation Tools
======================

Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/
---------------------------------------
Maven is a software project management and build automation tool.

Cloud Solutions
===============

Amazon Web Services: https://aws.amazon.com/
--------------------------------------------
Amazon Web Services provides a wide array of cloud computing solutions, from databases to file servers.
NOTE: Please sign up for your AWS account as soon as possible because the account verification process can take upward of an entire day.

Testing Tools
=============

Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/
----------------------------------------------

Postman is used for testing RESTful APIs. We'll use it to send HTTP requests to our APIs in order to test that we get the correct HTTP responses, etc.
